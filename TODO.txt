TODO:

A table for CDDB info
A table for extended metadata
A table for track ratings (trackID, user, rating)
A Python-based app for adding tags to files (python for the picard/musicbrainz libraries...)
Alternately, perl-based app to do same (...but this can be done by exporting picard's results to a CSV and using perl, which I like better)
A PHP-based Web app for generating a playlist based on metadata
	Generate form:
		For each tags type, make a column with checkboxes
			Tag types: genre, mood, style, favorite, content
		For each tag, add it to the appropriate column
		Add a column for rating 1-5 stars
		Add a double slider for track length
	Submit button generates a SQL query and outputs the resulting data to an M3U playlist
	Playlist link returned to browser or (if feasible) is passed to XMMS2 client to play over LAN.
		We can write a config for ezstream that points to a playlist we generated, then call ezstream with that config.
		That stream address can then be displayed to the viewer, or possibly passed directlyto their browser to load.
